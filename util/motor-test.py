#This file is part of the CPS-Rover Project of the State University of New York at Oswego.
#
#The purpose of this file is to turn on both GoPiGo motors and run them continuously.
#The script continuously monitors the battery voltage delivered to the motors as well as
#the elapsed ticks on both encoder wheels.
#This can be useful to test the speed difference between both motors, since production
#tolerances in the motors cause them to inevitably go at different speeds, resulting
#over time in largely unequal distances traveled (and hence the GoPiGo to slightly
#veer of course). Using this script, these differences can be measured and correlated
#to the voltage delivered to the motors to establish the change in differences over time.
