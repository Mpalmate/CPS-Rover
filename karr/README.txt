This project is still a work in progress. The controller is working correctly, just don't press the home button.

To run the controller, place all files in the Server folder on the rover (they are already on Karr) and run server.py.

All files in the Controller folder should be stored on the host computer. After server.py is running, then run control.py while a controller is plugged in.
