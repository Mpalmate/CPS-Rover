Welcome to the CPS-Rover Project of the State University of New York at Oswego.

The project is concerned with the properties of the development process of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). CPS are a novel system type, which combines properties of traditional system types, such as embedded systems, or information systems. For example, CPS observe the environment through sensors and acts upon it through actuators, like embedded systems. However, CPS also communicate with one another like information systems. CPS typically work together in order to dynamically form networks that collaboratively achieve goals individual systems cannot achieve alone. To this end, CPS networks can be homogeneous and heterogeneous and static and dynamic:
- Homogeneous CPS networks consist of a known number of CPS and a set of CPS with known properties, much like a Multi-Agent System.
- Heterogeneous CPS networks consist of a unknown number of CPS with an unknown set of properties.
- Static CPS networks consist if a fixed number of CPS.
- Dynamic CPS networks grow dynamically in size at runtime. 
This poses new challenges for the software development process.

In particular, this project looks at the differences between the development of homogenous and heterogeneous, static and dynamic CPS and traditional system types across all software engineering disciplines, from Requirements Engineering to Safey Assessment and Quality Assurance. To this end, the GoPiGo robot platform by Dexter Industries (www.dexterindustries.com) was chosen as a static, heterogeneous CPS network. The aim is to develop individual robots’ capabilities from a cyber physical perspective. 

Currently, there are four GoPiGo robots in this CPS network:
* KARR is a remote controlled, GPS enabled rover. Remote control makes use of a game controller over the wifi network.
* KAT navigates a labyrinth made up of perpendicular "paths," finds the exit, constructs a map of the labyrinth
  featuring a path to the exit, and sends the map to PLATO.
* KITT recognizes another Dexter Industries GoPiGo robot using the Raspberry Pi camera and drive towards it. 
* PLATO navigates a labyrinth made up of perpendicular "paths," according to a map that it received from KAT.

The purpose of the CPS network is to navigate all robots through the labyrinth. However, each robot can only contribute to the solution, but not solve it by itself.

Folders with robot names contain all necessary code and resources to execute the respective robot’s functionality.
The folder “util” contains cross-robot utilities.
